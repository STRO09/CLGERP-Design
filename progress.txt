Decided on the techstack to be MYSQL JDBC SERVLETS JSP/JSTLS along with daos, filters and listeners. 
design pattern to be mvc2. 
Project build maven.

Wrote bunch of sql queries left some and moved on forward with backend and middleware. 
had problems with maven. tried to delete the current project created mistakenly in the root Projects folder.
ended up deleting all projects permanently from disk.

More than enough practice with mysql, changing techstack to hibernate.
also changing login register system.
entry will be login page. if student / staff not registered yet, go to find details page search if details are
on the database or not. 
then register and then login.
added another role: admin (use only in admission period to enter student teacher details in the database.)

three roles now: student staff and admin.

In the process of designing frontend.
